Getting Started
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. To get started with the development server, you can run one of the following commands:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

You can then open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

Start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
